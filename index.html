            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a computer programming student based in Ottawa with a passion for software development. I graduated
                with
                an advanced diploma in Game Development from Algonquin College in 2021, where I learned and acquired a
                love
                for computer programming. I am currently enrolled in a computer programming program to expand my
                knowledge
                and take my skills to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                After completing an Advanced Diploma in Game Development at Algonquin College, I enrolled in Computer
                Programming at the same college. During my time in these programs, I have accumulated a wide skill set
                that
                includes C++, Java, C#, and a
                strong command of Object-Oriented Design. In my last year of Game Development, I
                participated in an eight-month long capstone project where all my skills were put to the test. Due to
                capstone being a large group project, I developed and improved other skills that are necessary to work
                in
                the industry such as teamwork, communication, project management, and leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experience, skill, and passion I have for software and technology have made into the core software
                developer I am today.
                Feel free to explore my site and or contact me!
